This is a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=4388

You can use this script to make vim behaves like CoqIDE.

This script works with +perl vim option.

Should work well on non-gui version of vim on unix system.

add the mapping :
<F2> undo last command
<F3> send next command
<F4> goto the command under the cursor
<F5> undo all commands
<F6> send all the buffer
<F7> refresh screen
<F8> kill coqtop

b : break computation (only when a command is being interpreted)

See comments at beginning of coq_IDE.vim for more informations.
